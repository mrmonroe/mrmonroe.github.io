# About Me
I love to code, play guitar, read, write and teach. I am a creative leader. A person who is unafraid to ask why and challenge the status quo, and remain respectful. I believe that why we do something is more important than what we do. I believe that a simple 'thank you' is the most important phrase we can say to our employees and coworkers.
  
## What I do for a living
Enterprise level architecture, design and development utilizing MERN, and many other development stacks, CI/CD, Openshift, In-Memory DB’s, Real Time systems, Event Driven Architecture, Voice and IVR platform augmentations, Monitoring and Alerting solutions and large multi-domain projects encompassing entire enterprise architectures.
